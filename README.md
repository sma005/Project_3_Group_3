# Project_3_Group_3
This project is part of the edX Data Visualization Bootcamp affiliated with Case Western Reserve University.

Group Members in this project are Steven Anthony, Kaleb Decker, Maddie Haughton, Em Needles, and Dena Wetmore.

The topic we have chosen is "date night activities"; we cleaned and analyzed data from the geoapify places API.

We cleaned the data and separated it into dataframes. Once the dataframes were completed we created an ERD on QuickDBD. The text that we input to QuickDBD is in the file schema.txt. We exported a png of the ERD which is found in the file ERD.png. We also exported the file schema.sql from Quick DBD which was used to create our tables in PostgreSQL.
